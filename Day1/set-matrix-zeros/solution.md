# Set Matrix Zeros - Solutions

## Problem Understanding

Before actually solving the problem we must understand the problem what the problem is all about

> Well, according to question,
>
> Given an `m x n` integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

We are given a matrix that has `m` rows and `n` column and if it contain `0` as a element than just simply set respective row and column to `0`

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/mat1.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 169px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
</pre>

> Note:
>
> As we can see in Example 1 -
>
> `0` is present at (1,1) index so respected row [0->m][1] will be set to zero
> and respected column [1][0->n]will be set to zero

## Approaches

We all know that a problem can have many solutions. however, we can classify solutions in three different categories

- Naive - [Brute force](./naive.md)

- Better than naive - [Better Solution]()

- Best solution - [Optimal Solution]()
